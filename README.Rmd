# butteR

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of butteR is to help in the analysis and visualization of survey data

## Installation


You can install the the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("zackarno/butteR")
```
## Example

One of the most useful functions is the "mean_prop_table" functions which aids in batching aggregations (calculating means and proportions from weighted data)

```{r example}
library(butteR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
